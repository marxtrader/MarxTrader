          "description": "We keep track of a number of crypto instruments. ask for a quote on one of todays most popular crypto coins. you can also ask for a random description of the instruments we cover. this is a great way to gain an understanding of how the coin is monetized, what need it tries to satisfy, and how those services are delivered. We start you out with a short watch list, containing bit coin, lite coin and ethereum. Say, brief me, to get current prices on cryptos you have an interest in. You can also add or remove items by saying, as an example, add ripple to my watchlist. and finally, you can ask for a detailed quote by saying, give me details, and then the crypto you want. There is also an order engine for paper trading. we start you with a 100000 dollar balance. just say, buy 5 bit coin. You can't go short, meaning you can't sell more coins than you own. To get a summary of your account, say, How am I doing, or give me an account summary."
